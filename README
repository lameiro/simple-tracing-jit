*This is a work in progress*

The purpose of this project is to build a simple, easy to understand interpreter with a tracing JIT. Tracing is a novel technique for improving the performance of interpreters and VMs described by Andreas Gal ( http://www.ics.uci.edu/~franz/Site/pubs-pdf/ICS-TR-07-12.pdf ). This technique has been implemented in the Python interpreter PyPy ( http://codespeak.net/pypy/extradoc/talk/icooolps2009/bolz-tracing-jit-final.pdf ) and Mozilla Firefox ( http://uci.academia.edu/AndreasGal/Papers/212381/Trace-Based_Just-In-Time_Type_Specialization_for_Dynamic_Languages ) with very good results.
